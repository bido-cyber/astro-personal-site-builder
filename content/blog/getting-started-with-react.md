# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. Created by Facebook, it has become one of the most popular front-end technologies in the world.

## What is React?

React is a **declarative, efficient, and flexible** JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

### Key Features

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: You can develop new features without rewriting existing code

## Setting Up Your First React App

To get started with React, you can use Create React App, which sets up a modern web app by running one command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will create a new React application and start the development server.

## Your First Component

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

Components can be written as functions or classes, but function components with hooks are now the preferred approach.

## State and Props

- **Props**: Read-only properties passed from parent to child components
- **State**: Local data that can change over time within a component

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`
- Understand component lifecycle and state management
- Explore popular libraries like React Router and Redux
- Practice building projects to solidify your understanding

React's ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving, making it an exciting technology to learn and master.
